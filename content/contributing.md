## How to contribute to The Library Project

The Library Project is made up of people from all walks of life. We aim for the project to reflect and represent the community it comes from.

To achieve this, we primarily encourage contributions from within the community itself — but we welcome support from anywhere it may come.

The Library Project often runs multiple initiatives at once, and each of these can benefit from your help, perspective, and creativity.

We accept contributions in three main forms -- in order of preference: 

1. labour (your time and skills)
2. material (items or goods)
3. Money

### How to contribute labour

Start by choosing a project that **speaks to you**. Explore our list of active projects and pick one that you believe matters most or where you can make the greatest impact.

Most projects welcome additional contributors, though occasionally a project may reach full capacity. Details about each project’s needs and current status can be found on its home page.

You don’t need to go online to get involved. If you meet someone connected to The Library Project, feel free to approach them *politely* and ask how you can participate — they’ll be happy to point you in the right direction.

### How to contribute material

Material contributions often begin with what you already have in surplus.

You might have:

- Books collecting dust on a shelf,
- Children’s clothes that no longer fit, or
- Artwork you’d love to share with your community.

We’d be glad to give these items new life and purpose.

At other times, a project might need something specific — like large pots for cooking or bottles of drinking water. Each project’s home page lists what’s currently needed and how to contribute those items.

And if you’re unsure where to start, simply reach out to someone involved in The Library Project. They’ll help guide you through the process.

Important: All contributions should be made openly. If anyone asks to make your contribution private without your consent, please treat that as a red flag and inform a project organizer.

### How to contribute money

It’s a simple truth that some projects require money to fill gaps that can’t be met through labour or material alone. While we prefer direct participation, we understand that financial support is sometimes necessary — and deeply appreciated.

We’re currently setting up a system to accept monetary contributions. Once that’s ready, we’ll update this page with clear instructions.
